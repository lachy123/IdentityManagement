TIME TO COMPLETION-
day 1. installing programs and dependencies necessary
day 2. reseaching different aspects of the task
day 3. learning aspects of springboot 
day 4. attempting to create simple springboot apps
day 5. attempting to make login system, as well as REST repository for task
day 6. Creating UI for springboot app
day 7. attempting to use docker to create container for app

I was unable to complete some aspects of the task, such as admininstator rights. I was able to create new entries through my app using a development environment, however i was not able to translate that into a UI for other users to create their own. Learning a lot of these programs from scratch limited my time to attempt to complete the project in its entirety.
